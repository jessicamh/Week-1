Here's what I want my agent to do:

1) scale my taxes based on how many subordinates I have
// protected void chooseTax(){...}
(see KhanSerai taxee)

2) store NatRes into reserves if alpha is high; use it all immediately on soldiers and attack someone with most of them if alpha is low (ideally, scale this)
// myTerritory.getAlpha() 
// myTerritory.produceSoldiers(#,#)
// attackingSoldiers = #
// defendingSoldiers = #
// attackedTerritoryID = (#)

3) redistribute wealth to subordinates if their wealth is less than 1/2 of mine (...if not possible, then just redistribute 1/4 of my wealth among all of them)

4) if someone becomes my lord, attack with 1/2 of soldiers if I have at least 2/3 of their wealth

5) *trade?* if alpha > 0.5, do not trade. if it's lower... *stuff.*

6) do not attack ally or own type or my subordinates. otherwise, attack weakest neighbor.
//if (___.getType() == _____)...
// See Kull getWeakestNeighbor, getNonSubordinateNeighbors

7) transfer soldiers to territory under control of allied lord if necessary (condition?)

8)
